# Luntti

Luntti is a collection of resources that I often find myself referring to when overcoming obstacles in programming, whether it be structuring an API or managing a complex software project.

## Best practices

### Node

- [Tao of Node](https://alexkondov.com/tao-of-node/) is a great article by Alex Kondov about structuring JavaScript / TypeScript applications, tooling, testing and performance. The article goes into detail about structuring the application into layers, validating requests properly using a library like [Joi](https://joi.dev/) or [Zod](https://zod.dev/), and much else.

### REST API

- [RESTful web API design](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/best-practices/api-design) is a great piece of documentation provided by Microsoft. It discusses the importance of organizing the API design around resources and defining operations in a semantically correct fashion using the standard [HTTP methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods).

## Project management

- [Milanote](https://milanote.com/) is great for managing a project using a board. You can use things like notes, todo lists, comments to compose and organize your project board. And it's free.

- [Clockify](https://clockify.me/) is a free time tracker that you can use to track how much time you've spent on a task. Not only is it great for overall time tracking, you can use it, for example, to keep track of billable working hours in client projects.

## Design, styling and CSS

- [Box shadows](https://getcssscan.com/css-box-shadow-examples) are less painful to come up with when you have an example as a starting point.

- [Dribble](https://dribbble.com/) for UI design inspiration.

- [Realtime Colors](https://realtimecolors.com/) if you want to test a color scheme on a real website with a clean UI.

- Tailwind provides a nice [color palette](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors).

- [Boxicons](https://boxicons.com/) for free high quality SVGs.
