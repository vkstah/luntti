# Luntti

Luntti is a collection of resources that I often find myself referring to when overcoming obstacles in programming, whether it be structuring an API or managing a complex software project.

## Best practices

### Node

- [Tao of Node](https://alexkondov.com/tao-of-node/) is a great article by Alex Kondov about structuring JavaScript / TypeScript applications, tooling, testing and performance.

### REST API

- [RESTful web API design](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/best-practices/api-design) is a great piece of documentation provided by Microsoft. It discusses the importance of organizing the API design around resources and defining operations in a semantically correct fashion using the standard [HTTP methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods).

## Project management

- [Milanote](https://milanote.com/) is great for managing a project using a board. You can use things like notes, todo lists, comments to compose and organize your project board. And it's free.
